# CUDAtrix
### A library for matrix and scalar operations with CUDA.

I made this repository to learn more about linear algebra and CUDA. As of now, it only supports
scalar operations, but I'm planning to add matrix operations soon.

All of the example usage of CUDAtrix functions is in the `/examples` directory.

Some resources that helped me create CUDAtrix:

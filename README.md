  <h1>CUDAtrix</h1>
  <h3>A library for matrix and scalar operations with CUDA.</h3>
</div>

I made this repository to learn more about linear algebra and CUDA.
As of now, CUDAtrix supports these operations:

- Matrix Sum
- Scalar Sum
- Matrix Multiplication
- Scalar Multiplication

And I'm planning on adding these operations:
- Vector Operations

All of the example usage of CUDAtrix functions is in the `/examples` directory.

Some resources that helped me create CUDAtrix:
